    <h2>Hello, I’m <span>Aron Kent Punasen Gavino</span></h2>
    <p>
      I was born on <strong>June 5, 2007</strong> at <strong>Benguet General Hospital</strong> and I currently live in the beautiful city of <strong>Baguio, Philippines</strong>, a place known for its cool weather and warm people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since I was young, I’ve always been curious and creative. I loved <strong>baking pastries</strong> while following online tutorials and experimenting at home. What started as a hobby soon became one of my greatest passions. Today, I can confidently bake a wide range of pastries without fear of failure, and each creation is a reflection of my patience, creativity, and love for the craft.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also have a deep interest in <strong>fashion and pageantry</strong>. Over the years, I’ve learned the art of walking gracefully in high heels. One of my favorite memories is when a close friend asked me to teach her how to do a <em>pasarela</em> or pageant walk during their intramurals in Grade 10, which reminded me how empowering it feels to share what I know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides baking and fashion, I’m passionate about <strong>photography</strong> and <strong>sports</strong>. I represented my school in <strong>volleyball</strong> at a district meet. Although we didn’t win, the experience and friendships we made were unforgettable. These days, I play occasionally when I have time.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I’m not baking or playing sports, I enjoy spending time playing <strong>online games</strong> like <em>Call of Duty</em> and <em>Mobile Legends</em>. Gaming teaches me teamwork, focus, and strategy, which also apply to real life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that I’m <strong>18 years old</strong>, I’m focused on my studies and building a bright future. I dream of <strong>flying abroad</strong> someday and starting my own <strong>tech company in the United States</strong>, combining creativity and innovation to make a positive impact.
